## Cloud Software Solutions

iMS3has developed a cloud based software, iMS-Cloud, that will centralize everything related to your Quality Management System.

We will custom build your own version of iMS-Cloud to suit your needs. We are ready for ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001, API 6A, & API Q1\.

Quality Management Systems should not be one more thing on your plate, but a flexible tool to increase efficiency, productivity, and eliminate wasted time doing paperwork.

iMS-Cloud will simplify your quality management needs, including but not limited to custom modules for:

* ##### Content Management
* ##### Document Management
* ##### NCR, CAR, PAR, and CI tools and resources
* ##### Process Automation
* ##### Email alerts
* ##### Competence & Training

We are very excited about what our software solution, iMS Cloud, has to offer, and the time and resources it can save.

From shared calendars, nonconformance & training to document control we can give you tools you need to help manage your business more effectively.  Our primary goal is to save you time and resources for what matters most.  With that in mind, what can we develop for you?

## Document Control

iMS Cloud has everything a small business needs in a document-management system. Most importantly, it can be used in all organizations, regardless of the type of computers they're using.  iMS Cloud is fully ISO 9001 ready, completed with approval process, versions, file check in and check out.

## Nonconformance

Manage your nonperformance of all types from a single location.  Any and all nonconformanecs from Accidents and Incidents, Service and Repair defects and customer complaints can easily be tracked by iMS Cloud and quickly and easily reported on.  We make it easier than every to consolidate, simplify, and analyze any and all nonconformances.

## Corrective Action

Old style manual paper-based quality management systems obstruct efficiency when coordinating corrective actions between multiple departments and people. By deploying an iMS Cloud, quality managers, department leads, and senior management  can obtain and assign corrective actions.  A business wide, real-time quality management system such as iMS Cloud allows key personnel to conduct root-cause analyses and forward results to quality managers via a single system, removing the problem of coordinating disparate software altogether.

## Process Automation

Reduce time spent following up on NCR's, CAR's, Continual Improvement Projects, Document Approval, etc...  iMS Cloud will automatically alert key personnel to upcoming dates, late notifications, and live updates directly from iMS Cloud for real time communication.  The fact is iMS Cloud makes it easier than ever to keep up to date with all aspects of your Quality Management system, saving untold hours of wasted time.

## Calibration

Tracking calibration schedules, due dates, conforming and nonconforming equipment can be quite a hassle resulting in wasted time, and putting your product quality at risk.  We have developed tools that allow you to manage all your equipment regardless of type (caliper, dial gauge, weld machine, precision equipment, etc...)  with alerts for upcoming equipment verification and calibration schedules.  With iMS Cloud you will have all the tools at your finger tips to stay in conformance.

## Competence & Training

Managing your training program can be one of the most difficult and time consuming parts of your job.  We have streamlined the process of scheduling, conducting, and recording training events.  But most of all we've made auditing your training program simple.  With just a few clicks you will be able to see not just what training someone has had but what they are lacking.  Even more, store all your training materials online in the cloud.
